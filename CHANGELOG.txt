## 2.0.3
Fixed bug with guild loot announcement format.

Fixed bugs with copying links.

Fixed bug in Snooper where message history would be cut short.

Snooper should cut off the name in emotes starting with special characters.


## 2.0.1
This is just some tweaks for version 2.0 to help make things feel more intuitive.

Listener Windows are easier to drag. Before they were a bit of a pain, and when you dragged the Snooper window it could potentially get stuck on your mouse.

Help notes have been reset, to remind you of what you need to know when you first load. 

Some other minor things have been moved around. 

More tooltips have been added.

The "eye" button hides itself if you aren't using filters for a window.


## 2.0.0
Major updates! Please report any issues using the Issue Tracker on the CurseForge page!

Optimizations. Lots of little things so that it might use less memory and be easier on your computer!

Redid interface. More intuitive, less cryptic.

Better cross-realm support. Mainly support for linked realms.

Ability to create new instances. Right click the upper left corner of the windows for options.

Better customization. Configuation can be accessed by right clicking the minimap button.

Custom channel support, to better facilitate RP that's done in channels.

Support for other chat channels as well, such as guild/officer. More flexibility in that regard, especially so you can see your communicator in the main window.

Removed hiding player name feature. Sorry, this was an obscure, early feature that was only meant to be a workaround.

Removed message highlighting in favor of a single red line. So modern...

Added tabs to the left hand side to mark things. Player text coloring has been removed to favor this (a green tab).

Mouseover highlighting has been turned into mouseover/target highlighting, and instead uses a red tab.

You can now click on messages to mark them, with a yellow tab. This is mainly meant for DMs to better manage which messages they have acknowledged.

Lightened old timestamps in snooper, so you can see them better.

Raid group filters. For example, you can create a window to only listen to groups 3 and 4, who are off exploring a separate trail!~

Removed custom chat colors in preference to default chat colors. If you liked it the other way, sorry!

Name shortener is now toggleable in the options.

URL detector. So you can click on links to copy them.

Keywords feature, to highlight specific things and notify you when they appear, such as your name.

The snooper has been redone to be more like an actual Listener window, and you can give it a load of customization.

DM Tags to help manage messages as a dungeon master. Gist of it is that it adds time labels (colored by priority/oldest) to your unit frames which you can double click after you've acknowledge/responded to someone's message.

Added a feature for copying text from the window. Sometimes you want to share your sweet suicide emotes with friends.

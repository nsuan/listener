SNOOPER

---------------------------------
 filters menu
 id is MAIN or SNOOPER
FILTERS_id
FILTERS_id_CHANNELS
FILTERS_id_MISC

FRAMEOPTS_#
FRAMEOPTS_#_NOTIFY
FRAMEOPTS_#_PLAYERS
FRAMEOPTS_#_PLAYERS_#
FRAMEOPTS_#_RAID
--FRAMEOPTS_#_FILTERS_MAIN
--FRAMEOPTS_#_FILTERS_MAIN_<etc>

the FILTERS_xyz is a bit iffy
snooper just uses straight up FILTERS_SNOOPER, and handles it like that
the frameopts handler needs the FRAMEOPTS_xyz_FILTERS name to find the
filters tag and populate the menu properly.

UPDATE, while not ideal, the FRAMEOPTS_x_ tag is not present with the filters menu
its just kept track by recording the frameopts index when opening the upper
menu
